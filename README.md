# ThatMattCat's Dotfiles

### Installation

The install.sh script will ask for Git username and email, currently there are references to the location of the script so it shouldn't be moved (this will be resolved sooner or later to clean up home directory).

```
cd ~
git clone git@github.com:ThatMattCat/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./install.sh [all,vim,bash]
```


### Info

Made for personal use, this is not optimized.

This script is currently used on Ubuntu 24 VMs. Installation on similar Ubuntu versions _should_ be fine, YMMV.
